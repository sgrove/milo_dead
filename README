MiLO - CoThink
---------------------------

MiLO is a non-sense acronym for a small translation tool being used and developed by the CoThink team. It's not intended to compete against such well-designed tools as pootle or F.I.T. Instead, it's just a simple tool to get us up and running on the rails framework and get create a simple small-scale translation tool that we can use to make the lives of our translators a bit easier.

We hope you'll find some use from it as well.
